# itk.js to itk-wasm Migration Guide

*Note: this migration guide is a work in progress.*

**itk-wasm** is a major upgrade with a focus on univeral, performant computing in
WebAssembly. The itk.js to itk-wasm transition also brings improvements
including modern, elegant programming interfaces, accelerated performance,
and execution beyond JavaScript thanks to [WASI](https://wasi.dev).

Most itk.js client code will simply need to update its import statements to
leverage itk-wasm. However, there are other more advanced changes. A
description of the changes, their motivation, and example migration code can
be found below.

### Module import statements

Browser module `import` statements have changed from:

```js
import IntTypes from 'itk/IntTypes'
```

to:


```js
import { IntTypes } from 'itk'
```

Or, to help bundlers with limited tree shaking,

```js
import { IntTypes } from 'itk/browser/index.js'
```


Node module import migration:

From:

```js
const IntTypes = require('itk/IntTypes.js')
```

to:

```js
import { IntTypes } from 'itk'
```

## Typescript support

Typescript support was added, but, of course, you can still just use
JavaScript if you wish.  Uses modern JavaScript constructs when appropriate,
e.g. classes.

## Bundlers

EcmaScript Module (ESM) support was improved.

There is now an improved approach for web workers for bundlers, CORS constraints.

## IO modules are available in separate packages.

IO modules are now installed in separate npm packages to limit the `itk-wasm`
package size. You can install only the packages that you need.

The version of these packages follow the `itk-wasm` package version and should
be kept in sync. The io packages are:

1. `itk-image-io`
2. `itk-mesh-io`
3. `itk-polydata-io`

An example that vendors these package's webassembly assets into an
application for deployment can be found in the [Webpack
Example](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-wasm/tree/master/examples/Webpack).

## itkConfig.js content and usage

The `itkConfig.js` specifies where to look for the io webassembly modules and
an optional default base URL for pipeline modules.

The default `itkConfig.js` is configured to use the
[JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN, but you may want to override this
default.

In the [Webpack
Example](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-wasm/tree/master/examples/Webpack)
the io webassembly module assets are vendored into `/itk` directories,
this module looks like:

```js
const itkConfig = {
  webWorkersUrl: '/itk/web-workers',
  imageIOUrl: '/itk/image-io',
  meshIOUrl: '/itk/mesh-io',
  polydataIOUrl: '/itk/polydata-io',
  pipelinesUrl: '/itk/pipelines',
}

export default itkConfig
```

And it can be injected into an application bundle by setting defining
`alias`'s to the configuration module for `../itkConfig.js` and
`../../itkConfig.js`. For other override configuration options, see the Webpack (todo),
Rollup (todo), and Unpkg (todo) examples.

### CLI options

The `--image, -i` command line option for the `build` subcommand is now a global option for all
subcommands. For examples

```
itk-wasm build --image insighttoolkit/itk-wasm src/dir
```

is now:

```
itk-wasm --image --source-dir src/dir insighttoolkit/itk-wasm build
```

## Image data structure

The `itk.Image.direction` is now directly a `Float64Array` -- `itk.Matrix` has
been removed.

`imageType.pixelType` is now a string enumeration.

Addresses an important issue in image orientation support.

### Node Sync functions

Node `*Sync` functions have been removed -- use the equivalent async versions instead.
